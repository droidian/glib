Description: Development utilities for GLib, GObject and GIO libraries
 GLib is a library containing many useful C routines for things such
 as trees, hashes, lists, and strings.  It is a useful general-purpose
 C library used by projects such as GTK, GIMP, and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains several developer-oriented command-line tools
 used when compiling packages that use GLib:
 .
  * gdbus-codegen
  * glib-compile-resources
  * glib-genmarshal
  * glib-gettextize

 .
 Other command-line tools can be found in the libglib2.0-bin package.
 .
 If the non-architecture-prefixed versions of the gi-compile-repository,
 gi-decompile-typelib and gi-inspect-typelib tools are required, please
 install the libglib2.0-dev package, but consider using the
 architecture-prefixed versions in the girepository-tools package instead.

 C library used by projects such as GTK+, GIMP, and GNOME.
 .
 This package is needed to compile programs against libglib2.0-0. It contains
 development utilities typically run during compilation and should not be
 installed directly. Use libglib2.0-dev instead.
# Implementation detail: This package contains the non-architecture-prefixed
# symlinks like gi-compile-repository -> ${multiarch}-gi-compile-repository

 C library used by projects such as GTK, GIMP, and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains developer-oriented command-line tools for working
 with GObject-Introspection typelibs and GIR XML, which are used to
 provide language bindings and documentation for GLib-based libraries:
 .
  * ${local:DEB-HOST-GNU-TYPE}-gi-compile-repository
  * ${local:DEB-HOST-GNU-TYPE}-gi-decompile-typelib
  * ${local:DEB-HOST-GNU-TYPE}-gi-inspect-typelib
 .
 When used via this package, these tools must be invoked with their
 host-architecture-specific names.
 .
 For command-line compatibility with non-Debian-based GLib packaging,
 the libglib2.0-dev package also provides versions of these tools for the
 system's primary architecture, named without the architecture prefix.
