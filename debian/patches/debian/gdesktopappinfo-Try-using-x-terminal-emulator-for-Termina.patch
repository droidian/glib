Subject: gdesktopappinfo: Try using x-terminal-emulator for Terminal=true
 apps

Debian Policy provides x-terminal-emulator as an interface for launching
a preferred terminal, for some definition of "preferred". However, the
x-terminal-emulator alternative is a system-wide choice, so in situations
where for example a GNOME user and a KDE user share a computer, only one
of them can have the terminal that will match their desktop environment's
appearance and behaviour conventions as the x-terminal-emulator.

As a result, we still try to use a GTK-based terminal as a higher
preference than x-terminal-emulator. This is done on the assumption
that when apps are launched using GLib interfaces, they are most likely
to have been launched from a GTK application or GTK-based desktop
environment, and therefore a GTK-based terminal will be the best fit for
the desktop environment's conventions and appearance.

I've somewhat arbitrarily sorted x-terminal-emulator as less preferred
than KDE's Konsole, but more preferred than rxvt and various xterm
variants which are not associated with a particular desktop environment.
